# Portfolio
This is a collection of demonstration projects, and is a work in progress.

The webpage itself is made with HTML, CSS (including some Grid), and a bit of JavaScript to allow a dark-mode toggle.

As will be immediate obvious, I did the web design myself, in addition to the coding.

It is deployed on Netlify with a custom domain: https://tamatha.dev
